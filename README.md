## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3/SCSS**: Utilizing advanced CSS techniques along with SCSS for efficient, maintainable styling. SCSS allows us to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, which help in writing CSS in a more structured way.
- **Sass (SCSS)**: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). We use SCSS syntax for more advanced features like variables, mixins, and nested rules that make the CSS more maintainable.
